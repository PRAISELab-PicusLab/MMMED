        "Question": "A clinical trial, published in New England Journal of Medicine, studied the effect of administering a subcutaneous anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin with respect to a placebo in patients with chronic anticoagulant treatment that were programmed for surgical intervention, to that oral anticoagulant was interrupted from a few days before surgery until postoperative 24 hours. Both heparin and placebo were administered subcutaneously from 3 days before and up to 24 hours before the intervention, and subsequently, from days 5 to 10 postoperative. The main analysis was to contrast if the placebo treatment (no bridging) was not lower than heparin (bridging), considering a margin of non -inferiority of 1% for the difference in the appearance of arterial thromboembolism.
